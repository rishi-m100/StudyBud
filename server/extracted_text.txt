how do you welcome back so let's go ahead and get right into this subject on pointers and we'll start out with their first declaration so here's our first Declaration of a pointer go ahead and decompose this to go ahead and discuss what the different parts mean but reading what is pee pee is going to be a pointer to an integer object that is he will eventually hopefully store the address of an integer object so and here it's going to be the bass type asterisk is going to be our declaratory operator pointer MP is going to be the identifier or the name of the object being creative remember a pointer is an object it's just it's value is going to be the address of another object but here's a quite a quick little spin on that we can initialize a pointer to the null pointer which essentially communicates that this thing is not pointing to anything it does not store what say the address of any object it's just it's blank you can think about it that way if we were to be saying down I don't know maybe let's say a phone number or something on an index card the index card could start out blank and we haven't written anything on it that's kind of what this is communicating here it's saying the pointer doesn't contain any useful information at this point
