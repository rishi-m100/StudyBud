To show that our code is correct\n    3. To reduce the risk of relying on our code\n    4. To improve software quality\n\n## Types of Testing\n- **Unit Testing**\n    - Test small pieces (units) of code in isolation\n- **Integration Testing**\n    - Test how multiple pieces of code work together\n- **End-to-end Testing**\n    - Test the entire application as experienced by users\n\n## What are Tests?\n- Automated pieces of code that verify the correctness of your code output\n- Make assertions about the output of code without considering the code implementation details\n- Not formal proofs of correctness, but check the cases you thought of\n\n## Writing a Test Suite\n- A test suite contains multiple tests for a given unit\n- Test cases should cover essential requirements and both happy and sad paths\n- Test cases should be small and focus on testing one or a few parts of the API surface\n\n## Writing Good Test Cases\n- A test case should assert either something about the output or that a certain exception was thrown\n- Descriptive naming of test cases is essential\n- Avoid having too many assertions in a single test case; consider splitting into multiple tests if needed\n- Test cases should not depend on external resources and be able to run offline\n\n## Integration Testing\n- Test cases should now test multiple components together to ensure they work in harmony\n- Balancing unit and integration tests depends on your project needs\n- Tests should still avoid external dependencies\n\n## End-to-end Testing\n- Test the entire application following core user journeys\n- Have external dependencies just like the real-world application\n\n## Improving Your Test Suites\n- Keep your tests DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) to avoid duplication\n- Utilize before blocks in testing libraries for shared setup code\n- Use mocking libraries to provide hardcoded implementations of the outside world for reproducible tests\n\n## Study Tips:\n- Understand the importance of different testing phases (Unit, Integration, End-to-End)\n- Practice writing descriptive and focused test cases\n- Familiarize yourself with mocking libraries for better test control\n- Regularly review your test suites to ensure they cover essential requirements\n\n## Study Schedule:\n### Week 1:\n- Read through the importance of automated testing and the types of testing\n- Review the concept of writing good test cases and test suites\n- Practice writing simple test cases for small code units\n\n### Week 2:\n- Explore integration testing concepts and begin applying them in your projects\n- Practice integrating multiple components and writing integration test cases\n- Start familiarizing yourself with mocking libraries for controlled testing environments\n\n### Week 3:\n- Dive into end-to-end testing and understand its significance in ensuring user journeys\n- Work on creating comprehensive end-to-end test scenarios for your applications\n- Review and optimize your test suites for efficiency and coverage\n\n### Week 4:\n- Engage in peer code reviews to gain insights into different testing approaches\n- Seek guidance from mentors on improving your testing strategies\n- Prepare for the upcoming Week 4 quiz on Intro to GitHub\n\n### Week 5:\n- Begin preparations for the Week 5 quiz on Intro to Testing\n- Revise all testing concepts covered so far and practice with sample questions\n- Reflect on your testing practices and make necessary adjustments based on feedback\n\n## Practice Questions:\n1. Why do we write automated tests for code? Provide at least three reasons.\n2. Explain the difference between unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.\n3. What should a good test case include? Mention at least three key aspects.\n4. When should one consider writing integration tests over unit tests?\n5. How can mocking libraries help in testing? Provide an example scenario.\n\n**Important Topics to Focus On:**\n- Importance and benefits of automated testing\n- Types of testing and their purposes\n- Writing effective test cases and test suites\n- Integration and end-to-end testing principles\n- Utilizing mocking libraries for controlled testing\n\nRemember, consistent practice, understanding core concepts, and seeking clarification on doubts will enhance your grasp of unit testing principles.
