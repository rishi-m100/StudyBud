How do you declare a 2D vector in C++?\n2. Explain the difference between `std::map` and `std::vector`.\n3. What is the purpose of a Makefile in C++?\n4. How do you perform basic input/output operations in C++?\n5. Describe the steps in the compilation pipeline for a C++ program.\n\n## Important Topics:\n- Vectors: Dynamic arrays in C++\n- Maps: Collection of key-value pairs in C++\n- Debugging Techniques in C++\n- Makefiles: Automating the build process\n- Git Commands: Version control system\n\nMake sure to review these topics thoroughly and practice coding examples to reinforce your understanding.
