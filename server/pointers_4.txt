Topic: Pointers

Overview:
This study guide will cover the topic of pointers in programming. Pointers are variables that store memory addresses as their values, allowing us to indirectly access data. Understanding pointers is crucial for programmers as they are frequently used to manipulate data structures and work with low-level memory operations.

Timeline:
- Introduction to pointers
- Declaration of a pointer
- Explanation of pointer parts
- Pointer to an integer object
