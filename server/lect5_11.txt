# Study Guide: Intro to Unit Testing

## Important Topics to Focus On:
- **Why do we write automated tests for code?**
    - Debugging
    - Ensuring code correctness
    - Risk reduction
    - Improving software quality
    
- **Types of Testing:**
    - Unit testing
    - Integration testing
    - End-to-end testing
    
- **What are tests?**
    - Automated pieces of code
    - Make assertions about code output
    
- **What to test:**
    - Small functions vs. complex functions
    - Testing the API not the implementation
    - Writing test suites
    
- **Writing Test Suites:**
    - Creating test cases
    - Covering essential requirements and paths
    - Writing good test cases
    
- **Integration Testing:**
    - Testing multiple components together
    - Balancing unit and integration tests
    
- **End-to-End Testing:**
    - Testing the entire application
    - Core user journeys testing
    
- **Improving Test Suites:**
    - DRY principle
    - Mocking libraries
    - Writing tests regularly
