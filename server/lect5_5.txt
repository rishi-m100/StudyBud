To show that our code is correct\n    3. To reduce the risk of relying on our code\n    4. To improve software quality\n    \n## Types of Testing\n- **Unit Testing:**\n    - Test small pieces (units) of code in isolation\n- **Integration Testing:**\n    - Test how multiple pieces of code work together\n- **End-to-end Testing:**\n    - Test the entire application as experienced by users\n\n## What are Tests?\n- Automated pieces of code that ensure the end result of your code is correct\n- Tests make assertions about the output of code, focusing on the end result\n- Tests are not formal proofs of correctness, but they check the cases you thought of\n\n## What to Test?\n- Test based on the cost of bugs and the complexity of the function\n- Test the API functionality, not the private methods\n- Test cases should cover all essential requirements and paths\n\n## Writing Good Test Cases\n- Each test case should assert something about the output or expected behavior\n- Descriptively name your test cases\n- Avoid having too many assertions in a single test case, consider splitting into multiple if needed\n\n## Writing Test Suites\n- A test suite contains multiple tests for a given unit\n- Test cases should cover all essential requirements and paths\n- Test cases should be small and focused, testing one or a few parts of the API surface\n\n## Integration Testing\n- Test multiple components together to ensure they work well in conjunction\n- Balance between unit and integration testing based on needs\n- Avoid external dependencies in tests\n\n## End-to-end Testing\n- Test the whole application following core user journeys to simulate real-world scenarios\n- Include external dependencies to mimic real-world conditions\n\n## Recommended Study Schedule:\n- Week 1-2: Understanding the importance of automated testing and different types of testing\n- Week 3-4: Writing test cases, test suites, and focusing on unit testing\n- Week 5-6: Learning integration testing and balancing between unit and integration tests\n- Week 7-8: Exploring end-to-end testing and improving test suites\n- Week 9-10: Enhancing test cases, practicing writing good test cases, and mock testing\n\n## Study Tips:\n- Practice writing test cases for simple and complex functions\n- Focus on understanding the purpose and expected outcomes of each test case\n- Collaborate with peers to review and discuss different testing strategies\n- Regularly attend mentor meetings for guidance on testing frameworks and best practices\n\n## Practice Questions:\n1. Why do we write automated tests for code?\n2. What is the difference between unit testing and integration testing?\n3. What should a test case assert in order to be effective?\n4. How can you improve your test suites for better coverage?\n5. When should you consider using mock testing in your test cases?\n\nBy following this study guide, understanding the concepts of unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, and practicing writing effective test cases, you will be well-prepared to excel in your Intro to Testing course.
