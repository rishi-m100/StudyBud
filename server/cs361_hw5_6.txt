  - Day 2: Practice problems related to geometric distributions.
  - Day 3: Solve problems on binomial distributions.
- **Week 2**
  - Day 1: Work on Poisson distribution problems.
  - Day 2: Revise expected value and variance calculations.
  - Day 3: Review all topics and solve mixed problems.

### Practice Questions:
1. What is the probability of observing a value greater than 0 in problem 1b?
2. Calculate the expected number of rounds that five people will play in problem 4c.
3. Find the probability that the airline flight in problem 5.8b travels with 1 or more empty seats.
4. Determine the probability of having exactly two new posts in problem 5.9c.
