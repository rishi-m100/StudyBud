Explain the difference between vectors and arrays in C++.\n2. Create a 2D vector with integers and iterate through it.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Resources:\n- [C++ Vector Reference](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/)\n- [C++ Map Reference](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/)\n- Explore more C++ tutorials and exercises for a deeper understanding.\n\n## Next Steps:\n- Review the lecture notes and slides for a better grasp of the concepts covered this week.\n- Complete any practice problems or assignments related to vectors, compound data, and maps.\n- Stay consistent with your study schedule and regularly practice coding to improve your skills.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
