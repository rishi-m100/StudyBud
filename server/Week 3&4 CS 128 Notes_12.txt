# Computer Science 128 Study Guide

## Week 3

### Monday:
- **Topics Covered**: Vectors, Compound Data
- **Key Points**:
  - Vectors in C++ are dynamic arrays that can store elements of the same type.
  - Compound data in the standard library includes containers, iterators, and algorithms like vectors.
- **Study Tips**:
  - Practice initializing and using vectors with different data types.
  - Understand the methods and behaviors associated with vectors in C++.
- **Practice Questions**:
  1. How do you declare and initialize a vector in C++?
  2. Explain the difference between accessing elements in a vector using `[]` and `.at()`.

### Tuesday:
- **Topics Covered**: 2D Vectors
- **Key Points**:
  - 2D vectors in C++ are similar to nested vectors, creating a matrix-like structure.
  - Use 2D vectors for storing data in rows and columns.
- **Study Tips**:
  - Practice initializing and iterating through 2D vectors.
  - Understand the concept of vectors of vectors for handling 2D data.
- **Practice Questions**:
  1. How do you declare a 2D vector in C++?
  2. Explain how to access elements in a 2D vector using the `at()` method.

## Tips for Effective Studying:

- **Consistent Practice**: Regularly practice coding to solidify concepts.
- **Interactive Learning**: Engage in coding challenges and group study sessions.
- **Ask for Help**: Reach out to peers, instructors, or online resources for clarification.
- **Create Summaries**: Write concise summaries of each topic for quick revision.

## Study Schedule:

- **Day 1**: Focus on understanding vectors in C++. Practice initialization and manipulation.
- **Day 2**: Dive into 2D vectors and practice creating and accessing elements.
- **Day 3**: Review compound data structures and implement algorithms using vectors.
- **Day 4**: Consolidate knowledge with practice questions and revision.

Remember to stay consistent in your study routine and seek help when needed. Good luck with your studies!',
